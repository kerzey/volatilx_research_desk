# Platform issues register

Defects and hazards in the VolatilX platform that the desk has found while doing its own work.
This is the follow-up list Haci asked for. It is separate from the LEDGER (verdicts on research
questions) and the BACKLOG (hypotheses). Anything here that becomes a *behaviour change* to
scoring or selection still goes through a research question and a full IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF
(CLAUDE.md rule 11). Plain bug fixes take the short route below.

## How an issue gets fixed

1. Desk finds it, records it here with evidence (`path:line`, dates, a reproducing query).
2. Haci decides: **fix** (bug — short route), **research first** (it might be a feature, not a
   bug), or **accept** (document and move on).
3. Short route: `@brief-writer fix-brief PI-NNN` produces `research/briefs/PI-NNN_slug.md` — a
   self-contained prompt for the coding agent in the platform repo, with the reproducing query,
   the expected behaviour, a test, and a rollback. No feature flag is needed for a fix that
   restores intended behaviour, but the brief still names a before/after check.
4. Haci runs the brief in the platform repo, records the PR / SHA here, and the steward
   confirms on the next freeze that the data changed as expected. Then status → `VERIFIED`.

Statuses: `OPEN` · `HACI_DECIDED:<fix|research|accept>` · `BRIEF_WRITTEN` · `IMPLEMENTED:<sha>` · `VERIFIED` · `ACCEPTED`

| ID | Severity | Status | Issue |

| PI-003 | med | OPEN | `atr_pct` corrupted around splits (ATR computed on raw bars) |
| PI-004 | med | OPEN | Manual re-runs indistinguishable from nightly runs in `super_agent_select_runs` |

## Detail

### PI-001 — fwd_return freeze not fixed
**Evidence:** FREEZE_v001 §5. `fwd_return_30d_pct` coverage 99% → 0% from 2026-05-20;
14d from 06-12; 5d from 06-26; writes resume 07-06 at ~5% of baseline; 30d back to 0% for
`trading_date ≥ 07-27`, well past maturation. CLAUDE.md said "fixed" — corrected 09-10.
**Desk impact:** none now — the desk computes forward returns from its own price freeze.
**Platform impact:** anything on the product that reads these columns (UOA performance surfaces)
is showing mostly nulls. **Recommend: fix.**

### PI-002 — no watchdog caught PI-001
**Evidence:** a ~95% shortfall persisted for 3+ months. `grep` for a fwd_return coverage
watchdog finds only `scripts/phase2_signals/feasibility.py:7`, a one-off feasibility note.
**Recommend: fix** — a nightly coverage check with a threshold (the desk's own
`research/lib/daily_check.py` shows the shape: trailing median, floor, RED on a drop).

### PI-003 — ATR corrupted around splits
**Evidence:** EXPLORE_001 §9. BKNG `atr_pct` up to 0.49 (true ≈ 0.04–0.06), CVNA up to 0.55.
Cause: ATR over raw bars spanning a split. The W60 grader already de-splits bars
(`scripts/backfill_w60_outcomes.py:185-193`); the ATR path does not.
**Platform impact:** any ATR-based target or sizing on a recently split name is wrong for ~14
sessions. **Recommend: fix**, reusing the grader's de-split.

### PI-004 — manual runs look like nightly runs
**Evidence:** runs for 05-11, 05-12, 05-13, 05-14, 07-06 finished after the next session had
opened (`finished_at`), with mixed-date `spot_close` (TER 07-06: −9.6%). Haci confirms these
were manual development re-runs. Nothing in `super_agent_select_runs` marks them as such.
**Desk impact:** handled by `research/data/exclusions_v001.json`.
**Recommend: fix (small)** — a `run_kind` column (`nightly` / `manual` / `backfill`) written by
the entry point, so the next manual run is self-declaring. Also lets the product hide manual
runs from subscriber-facing history.

### PI-005 — regime history backfilled
**Evidence:** FREEZE_v001 §7. Three `regime_version` rows per date for 01-02..06-08, all
written 06-02 / 06-08. Live same-night writes only from 06-09.
**Recommend: accept**, with the desk rule "regime-stratify from 06-09 only". Nothing to fix
going forward; the label is now written on the night.

### PI-006 — picks without a ladder
16 published picks lack lane targets in `public_payload_json`. A subscriber saw a pick with no
plan. **Recommend: fix** — publication should require all three lanes' targets, or mark the
pick as plan-pending.

### PI-007 — `industry` mostly empty
12% populated. Blocks sector-cluster questions (H-034) and any sector-aware product feature.
**Recommend: fix** — populate from the fundamentals source already used for `fundamental_quality`.

### PI-008 — smart-money weight is zero
`services/super_agent_select_scoring.py:709-710` forces the weight to 0 when
`enable_smart_money_enrichment` is off; the column has been null since April. Not a bug — a
disabled feature — but CLAUDE.md's "smart-money 5" and any marketing of a seven-layer score
overstate it. **Recommend: accept + docs**, or decide whether to enable.

### PI-009 — targets are distance, not forecast *(research first)*
EXPLORE_001: L1/L2 median 0.31 / 0.55 ATR from the close. The strategist prompt asks for two
targets per lane with no volatility scaling (`ai_agents/principal_agent.py:530-575`). If the
sealed period confirms H-053, the change is ATR-scaled target placement — a scoring/plan
behaviour change, so: PREREG → verdict → HUMAN_APPROVED → full brief with a shadow ladder.

### PI-010 — elite is thinning *(research first)*
Published 90+ picks per month fell from 12–13 (May–Jun) to 3 (Aug) and 2 (Sep to the 10th);
the candidate median score fell 67.3 → 62.7 on 09-10 (daily check). Haci wants to know why.
Candidates: score-distribution drift after the 06-01 catalyst fix, weaker tape, GEX nulls
(+5 completeness offset), or universe changes. This is a Registrar question (calibration
family F2), not a fix.
